A pure C++ 2D racing game(road running) using Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL) library.
No game engine is used everything is done from scratch including loading sprites, collision detection, button events, game loop,etc.
I decided to do everything from scratch just to so i could learn how things are done at the lower level.
The project is currently not complete....
